## Abstract

Per-task selection of an agent's reasoning paradigm has a large, measured prize: oracle
selection beats the best fixed paradigm by 17.1pp, and the best published router recovers
about a quarter of that gap while zero-shot self-routing recovers negative value. We argue
the bottleneck is not selector capacity but decision framing, and we develop three results
in front of the learning problem rather than inside it.

First, **feasibility is arithmetic**. Whether a topology can run a task is computable from
declared quantities — unit count, unit length, budget — with no model call and no
statistics. On a corpus scaled from 16k to 1.27M tokens this prunes three of seven
candidate topologies before any token is spent, and it separates two failure modes that
are routinely conflated: map-reduce is bounded by *cardinality*, not by total size.

Second, **selection pays only under a precise condition**. We give the Selection Value
Theorem, `π·α·G > (1−π)·β·L`, and its corollaries: a router obliged to always choose has no
control over its false-positive rate, so optimal coverage is generally well below one. We
further show that where a cheap failure detector exists, escalation dominates prediction —
a router that misroutes pays a quality loss, a cascade pays a cost loss — which partitions
the problem by verifiability rather than by task type.

Third, and empirically, **tool surface governs the variance that topology choice is
credited with**. Across four feature cells, paradigms that do not use tools span a 1.2×
cost range; paradigms that do span 50×. Adding one signal — that the retriever has
returned nothing new for three consecutive searches — cut the cost of the most
elaborate topology by 3.05× against a replicate spread of 1.62× on the same measure.

We contribute the theory, a machine-checked measurement layer, a corpus generator with
exact ground truth at four scales, and a preliminary failure analysis of seven topologies.
We do not yet contribute a validated selector.

# 1. Introduction

## 1.1 A measured prize that nobody captures

An LLM agent's *paradigm* — the control structure wrapped around the model, such as a
single call, a reasoning loop, a decomposition, or a verify-replan graph — is normally
chosen once at design time and frozen in code. Recent work measures what that costs.
Across six paradigms, four frontier models and ten benchmarks (~18,000 runs), oracle
per-task selection beats the best fixed paradigm by **17.1pp** on average, with individual
swings as large as +44pp and −15pp depending on the pairing [Select-then-Solve,
arXiv:2604.06753].

The same work shows the prize is not being collected. A trained embedding router recovers
roughly a quarter of the gap. Zero-shot self-routing — asking the model to pick its own
paradigm — recovers *negative* value: two models fall below their own single-paradigm
baselines, one to 27.5%.

So: the prize is large, the best published attempt captures a minority of it, and the naive
attempt is worse than not trying. That pattern invites the conclusion that better selectors
are needed. We argue it invites a different one.

## 1.2 Three claims that precede the learning problem

**Feasibility is arithmetic, and it is free.** Before asking which topology is *best*, one
can ask which can *run*. That question is answerable from quantities the task already
declares. A learned policy that spends episodes discovering that map-reduce loses on
500-unit tasks is learning arithmetic the hard way; the cap was computable before the first
token.

**Selection pays only under a precise condition.** A router that must always choose has no
degree of freedom over its false-positive rate and therefore pays for every misroute. We
formalise when selection beats a fixed fallback and show that the optimal operating point
generally involves abstaining on most requests — which is not a weaker router but a
different objective.

**Much of what is attributed to topology is attributable to tools.** In our measurements
the paradigms that use retrieval tools span a fifty-fold cost range while those that do not
span 1.2×. A benchmark that does not report the quality of its tool surface is not
comparing topologies; it is comparing one retriever wrapped seven ways.

## 1.3 What this draft does and does not establish

Established: the theory (§5), machine-checked against synthetic distributions with known
answers; a feasibility layer (§4) validated across four corpus scales; a corpus generator
whose ground truth is re-derived independently from the documents (§6).

Preliminary: every empirical number in §7 and §8 is n=1 per cell on one corpus with one
model. Replicate variance on the most elaborate topology was measured at up to 3.93× in
cost, so magnitudes are indicative. The *mechanisms* are more robust than the magnitudes,
because they rest on tool-usage traces rather than on effect sizes.

Not established: a validated selector, any result on public benchmarks, and any claim about
a regime other than exact-answer extraction over document collections.

# 2. Related work

## 2.1 Automatic workflow search

AFlow reformulates workflow optimisation as search over code-represented workflows with
MCTS over operators [arXiv:2410.10762]; ADAS and GPTSwarm search related spaces. These
produce **one** workflow per benchmark, offline. Our concern is per-request selection among
a fixed set, and — before that — which members of the set can run at all.

## 2.2 Inference-time paradigm selection

Select-then-Solve trains a lightweight embedding router to pick a paradigm per task
[arXiv:2604.06753]. FlowBank builds a portfolio offline and selects per query
[arXiv:2606.11290]. TRACE-Router routes at the granularity of a task trace rather than a
request [arXiv:2607.22465]. Uno-Orchestra learns a joint decomposition-and-dispatch policy
[arXiv:2605.05007].

All of these operate at **coverage one**: every task receives a paradigm. §5.1 argues that
this is the binding constraint rather than model capacity, and none of them reports a
risk-coverage curve.

## 2.3 Cost models for workflows

GLOW predicts agentic workflow performance from graph and language features
[arXiv:2512.15751]; Cost-Aware Optimization for Agentic Query Execution draws the analogy
to classical query optimisation explicitly [arXiv:2606.03152]. We take the analogy as
settled and do not claim it. Our addition is upstream: a hard feasibility filter that a
cost model does not replace, because an infeasible plan has no cost.

## 2.4 Symbolic governance over probabilistic inference

Structured Cognitive Loop introduces Soft Symbolic Control as a governance layer applying
symbolic constraints to probabilistic inference, with a deterministic control runtime and
full decision traceability [arXiv:2511.17673]. This is the closest related work to §6.2.
It operates as a **single global mode**; it does not graduate assurance per request, derive
the required level from beliefs about the request, restrict the admissible plan space by
level, or calibrate model-stated confidence. Those four are what we add.

MINERVA proposes the HADD paradigm — hybrid agents with deterministic decisions in
regulated domains — and supplies the vocabulary we adopt for the boundary gate and the
Kautz Type-2 framing [Zenodo 10.5281/zenodo.20003407].

## 2.5 Selective prediction and learning to defer

Our theory is an application of an established framework. Chow's rule gives optimal
rejection; Mozannar and Sontag give a consistent surrogate for deferral to an expert
[PMLR v119]; Verma and Nalisnick add calibrated one-vs-all deferral [arXiv:2202.03673];
Mohri and colleagues give principled multi-expert formulations. We contribute the
application to paradigm selection and the specific corollaries in §5.1, not the framework.

## 2.6 Agents that learn without weight updates

Experiential memory approaches — ExpeL, experiential reflective learning, MemSkill, R²-Mem
— accumulate insights, rules or memory entries. Sleep-time compute shifts inference to idle
time and reports ~1/5 the tokens at inference [Letta]; SCM and related work add
biologically-inspired consolidation [arXiv:2604.20943, arXiv:2605.26099]. All consolidate
*content*. §6.3 consolidates the *control policy*, which we have not found elsewhere,
though we flag this as an unverified novelty claim.

## 2.7 Evaluation and judges

We deliberately use no LLM judge. A large-scale study across 21 models and 541,000
judgments reports reliability without validity, and that raw agreement overstates
discriminative ability [arXiv:2606.19544]. RAGAS-style metrics exhibit position, verbosity
and self-enhancement bias, and the recommended mitigation is repeated runs with spread
inspection. Since our effect sizes are single-digit percentage points and judge variance is
of the same order — and since verbosity bias would systematically favour the expensive
paradigms whose value is in question — a judge would introduce a bias aligned with the
hypothesis. §6.1 explains the alternative.

# 3. Preliminaries

A **task** `t` supplies a question, a set of *units* (documents), a declared token budget,
and flags for irreversibility and shared-state writes. A **paradigm** `p ∈ P` is a control
structure that may call tools and must emit an answer. **Quality** `q(t,p) ∈ [0,1]` is set
F1 against an exact oracle. **Cost** `c(t,p)` is total tokens over every call the paradigm
makes.

The **best fixed paradigm** is `p⋆ = argmax_p E_t[u(t,p)]`. The **oracle** is
`E_t[max_p u(t,p)]`, and the **oracle gap** is their difference. Utility is
quality net of a cost preference:

```
u(t,p) = q(t,p) − λ · (c(t,p) / min_{p'} c(t,p') − 1)
```

Normalising by the cheapest paradigm on that task makes λ interpretable — the quality one
will trade for one extra multiple of the minimum cost — and λ=0 recovers pure quality
exactly. **No single λ is chosen**: raw quality and raw cost are stored unmodified and the
trade-off is applied at analysis time, so results are reported as a function of λ rather
than under an assumption about it.

The seven paradigms are Direct, CoT, ReAct, Map-Reduce, Plan-Execute, Reflection, and a DAG
with verify-replan over a shared blackboard. Five mirror the Select-then-Solve grid so
numbers can be checked against theirs; Map-Reduce is added because it should win on high
cardinality, and the DAG because a comparison that omits the most elaborate available
topology is stacked in favour of the simple ones.

# 4. Feasibility is arithmetic

## 4.1 The check

Whether `p` can run `t` depends on quantities `t` already declares. With `n` units, content
`C` tokens, budget `B`, and an allowance `A = 0.6·B` that leaves room for the conversation:

| paradigm | binding constraint | infeasible when |
|---|---|---|
| Direct, CoT | one prompt holding every unit | `C > A` |
| Map-Reduce | one call per unit, then a reduce over all partials | `n > 80` or `n·f > A` |
| DAG | sub-questions × iterations × replans | projected calls > 200 |
| ReAct, Reflection | own iteration cap; reads selectively | never |

where `f` is the projected size of one finding. No model call, no statistics, no learning.

## 4.2 It separates two failure modes that are routinely conflated

Applied to **168 tasks across five corpora** from the same generator, each task carrying
its own declared budget:

| corpus | tokens/unit | units/task | max content | Direct, CoT | Map-Reduce |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| gold_v2 | 232 | 60 | 16k | 39/39 | 39/39 |
| gold_v3 | 2,147 | 60 | 152k | 12/39 | 39/39 |
| gold_wide | 264 | 500 | 135k | 20/32 | **18/32** |
| gold_deep | 7,161 | 60 | **483k** | 2/26 | **26/26** |
| gold_xl | 2,499 | 500 | 1,272k | 8/32 | 18/32 |

Feasible tasks over total. The four remaining paradigms are feasible in **168/168**.

Aggregated over paradigms, the admissible plan space contracts monotonically with scale —
**273/273 cells on gold_v2, 186/224 on gold_wide, 134/182 on gold_deep, 162/224 on
gold_xl**: from 100% admissible down to 72%, entirely by arithmetic and before any token is
spent. A selector operating without this layer would have to learn that quarter of the
space is unreachable, one failed episode at a time.

**The decisive pair is gold_wide against gold_deep.** gold_deep carries 3.6× more content,
and Map-Reduce moves from 18/32 feasible to **26/26** while Direct and CoT collapse to
2/26. Total size does not predict Map-Reduce's feasibility; **cardinality does**. At 483k
tokens over 60 units it runs, because it never holds them together. At 135k over 500 units
it does not: 501 calls, and a reduce concatenating 500 findings. Treating its limit as a
context limit leads to discarding it exactly where it works.

The same accumulation bound applies to the DAG's blackboard, which renders every finding
into every sub-agent prompt.

**How hard the read-everything constraint bites is easy to underestimate.** In gold_deep a
*single-unit* task is infeasible for Direct, because one document is 8,075 tokens against
an allowance of 4,800. The constraint is not "the corpus is large" but "the smallest
addressable piece already does not fit", and no amount of selective reading changes that
for a paradigm whose only move is to read.

**A second reading worth stating plainly.** The four selective paradigms are feasible in
every one of the 168 tasks. That is a real property — they cap their own iterations and
read on demand — but it also bounds what this layer can do. Feasibility constrains only
paradigms that either hold material in context or fan out per unit; **it offers no
protection against a selective paradigm spending its way through a 1.27M-token corpus**.
That protection has to come from a budget, not from arithmetic over the corpus, and §7.2
shows why it is needed: the selective paradigms are exactly the ones whose cost varies
fifty-fold.

## 4.3 Why this belongs in front of the learning problem

Feasibility is deterministic, free, and upstream of everything else. It prunes the plan
space before any selection, learned or otherwise. **The corollary for production is that
knowing the length and declining is not a degradation** — it is the difference between a
bounded system and a runaway.

\1

**Measured, and the distinction is not academic.** On four gold_deep cells, Direct was
pruned on three and ran on one, where it scored 1.000. Recorded as wrong answers those
three would make Direct's mean 0.250 — the worst paradigm in the table. Recorded as
infeasible, the statement is the accurate one: *best where it can run, unavailable where it
cannot.* The same layer that protects the study from a false conclusion is the layer a
production system needs to decline instead of failing.

# 5. Theory

## 5.1 The Selection Value Theorem

Let `p⋆` be the fallback and `p_s` a specialist. Let `S = {t : u(t,p_s) > u(t,p⋆)}` with
`π = Pr[t ∈ S]`. Let `α = Pr[route to p_s | t ∈ S]` and `β = Pr[route to p_s | t ∉ S]`, and
let `G_α`, `L_β` be the mean gain and mean loss **conditioned on the routed subsets**.

**Theorem 1.** `V(r) − V(p⋆) = π·α·G_α − (1−π)·β·L_β`, exactly. Hence selection beats the
best fixed paradigm iff

```
π · α · G_α  >  (1 − π) · β · L_β
```

Conditioning the gain and loss on the *routed* subsets rather than on `S` makes the identity
exact with no independence assumption, and it separates coverage quality (`α`, `β`) from
selection quality within coverage (`G_α` versus the unconditional `G`).

**Corollary 1 (precision over coverage).** When `p⋆` is near-optimal over wide regions, `G`
is small and `L` large, so the condition demands `β → 0` even at the cost of `α`. Recall is
not the objective.

**Corollary 2 (impossibility threshold).** `β_max = π·α·G_α / ((1−π)·L)`. Any router above
it loses to always-fallback however good its specialists are. `L` here must be the
*distributional* loss, not the realised one: computed from the realised loss the threshold
is circular, and a perfect router — which realises no loss — would report an infinite
bound and appear unconstrained.

**Corollary 3 (optimal coverage).** With a calibrated confidence and a variable threshold,
captured value is unimodal in coverage and the optimum generally has coverage ≪ 1. A router
obliged to choose has no control over `β` at all.

**Identity.** The oracle gap equals `π·G`. The 17.1pp reported for a published suite *is*
`π·G` for that suite, which allows a router's implied `β` to be recovered from its headline
numbers.

All of the above is verified in `tests/test_science.py` against distributions whose terms
are known by construction, including the negative case where a router above `β_max` is
confirmed to capture negative value.

## 5.2 Cascade dominance, and its measured correction

A **router** that errs pays `L`, a quality loss: a worse answer is delivered and nothing
recovers it. A **cascade** that errs pays `cost(p_1)`, a cost loss: the cheap attempt is
wasted and the good answer still arrives after escalation.

With detector sensitivity `s`:

```
regret(router)  = (1−π)·β·L
regret(cascade) = E[ladder cost] + (1−s)·L
```

**A correction we owe to measurement.** An earlier statement of this result gave the cost
term as `cost(p_1)`. That is false. When no rung satisfies the detector the cascade runs the
*whole ladder*: in our synthetic study it captured 100% of the gap at **4.4×** the cost of
the best fixed paradigm. The bound is the expected ladder cost, and the pattern requires a
budget cap.

**Detector sensitivity is the critical variable, and a weak detector is catastrophic rather
than merely suboptimal.** At `s = 0.6` the captured fraction measured **−5.98**: a missed
failure leaves the cascade halted on a cheap rung with a bad answer. This is the structural
analogue of Corollary 2 — as a router with high `β` loses, a cascade with low `s` loses, and
loses harder.

**Corollary (the verifiability partition).**

```
v = 1  (a cheap oracle exists)  ->  cascade; no router needed
v = 0  (no oracle)              ->  route, under the discipline of Theorem 1
```

Prediction is only necessary where verification is impossible. If this holds, much of the
routing literature is solving the wrong problem in the verifiable regime.

# 6. Design

## 6.1 Measurement without a judge

Every task carries a set-valued oracle, so quality is set F1 after normalisation. §2.7 gives
the reason: the effect is single-digit percentage points and judge variance is of the same
order, so a judge would not merely add noise but a bias — verbosity bias favours the long
answers that the expensive paradigms produce, which is precisely the comparison under test.

An empty oracle is a legitimate and important question — *list every X* where no X exists —
and it tests whether a paradigm invents items. It is graded by requiring an explicit
statement of emptiness; silence scores zero, because a paradigm that returned nothing
because it crashed must not score as one that looked and reported finding nothing.

## 6.2 Beliefs, provenance, and per-request assurance

Full determinism is unavailable for an LLM, and pursuing it by excluding the model from the
decision discards information the model has. We invert it: the model is a **sensor** that
emits typed propositions with a credence and a **provenance**, and a deterministic symbolic
layer reasons over the belief base. The guarantee changes shape:

> not *"the same prompt yields the same answer"* — false, always
> but *"the same belief base yields the same decision"* — true, and the base is recorded

Provenance carries the weight: `COMPUTED` (a pure function, credence 1.0) > `OBSERVED`
(measured by executing a probe) > `ELICITED` (the model asserted it, subject to calibration)
> `ASSUMED`. A rule may demand a minimum provenance, so an irreversible action can be
restricted to computed and observed evidence: *a model's opinion that an action is safe is
not admissible evidence for taking it.*

Assurance is then a property **of the request**, not of the system. A global mode makes all
traffic pay for the strictest request. Four levels graduate the provenance floor, whether θ
may learn online, whether the run is replayable from cache, and **which patterns are
admissible** — the certified level excludes topologies whose control flow is unbounded, not
because they are worse (they are often better) but because their failure modes are not
enumerable. The floor is derived from beliefs about the request: a caller may ask for more
and never for less.

Credence and effect size must not be conflated. A learned margin is a *certain* belief about
a *large* effect — credence 1.0, value 0.9 — and encoding the magnitude as credence reports
a computed fact as an uncertain one, destroying the distinction the layer exists for.

## 6.3 Consolidation of the control policy

Learning is offline and copy-on-write. Episodes are replayed in order of *surprise* rather
than chronology, removing the recency bias the online update has by construction; statistics
are downscaled and unused entries pruned; and an abstraction stage searches for feature
partitions that separate paradigms better than the current binning.

Two disciplines make this safe. A candidate policy is installed only if it does not regress
on held-out episodes. And the record is split three ways *by task* — one part proposes
partitions, one scores them, one is touched only by the promotion guard — because searching
many partitions against one holdout is how detecting a truth becomes confabulating one. A
discovered partition enters with zero episodes, below the confidence floor, and cannot drive
a decision until it has earned evidence: **a dream is a hypothesis, not a fact.**

Verified: given a record where utility is independent of every attribute, no partition
survives validation.

## 6.4 The tool surface is part of the topology

Choosing *which* retrieval modality, at *what* granularity, in *what* sequence, with how
much *batching* is the agent's own business — it is the topology. A harness offering one
blunt search and one read has pre-decided all four and then measures what remains.

Four tools at three granularities, with lexical and dense exposed separately alongside the
fused entry point:

| tool | returns | measured size, 3 units |
|---|---|---|
| `search` | summaries | 312 chars |
| `keyword_search` | highlights `<< >>` | 937 |
| `semantic_search` | full text | 3,502 |
| `read` | full text, batched | 3,501 |

**11× between summarising and reading**, and that difference is invisible when every search
returns a fixed-size excerpt. Fusing lexical and dense into a single hybrid tool was a
specific mistake: hybrid is the right default, but exposing only the fused view means the
agent can never request exact matching for an identifier — and the answers in two of our
cells *are* identifiers.

Retrieval quality is a recorded variable with five arms: hybrid (BM25 + dense, RRF fusion),
lexical, semantic, two degraded simulations at stated recall and precision, and an oracle.
The simulations are deterministic functions of `(task, query, unit)`, so retrieval quality is
a controlled dial rather than another noise source. Vectors are cached by content hash, so
after a first pass fusion is local arithmetic.

**A finding against the received view**: on the coupled cell, dense alone measured recall
0.75, hybrid 0.50, lexical 0.25. RRF averages ranks, so a badly performing component drags a
good one down. "Hybrid is always better" does not hold when one component is far below the
other.

## 7.1 The aggregate over four feature cells

| paradigm | mean quality | total tokens | cost range | hallucinated units |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| **Direct** | **0.938** | **46,101** | 1.2× | 0 |
| CoT | 0.938 | 46,272 | 1.2× | 0 |
| ReAct | 0.688 | 116,524 | **27.6×** | 0 |
| Reflection | 0.688 | 126,254 | 6.9× | 0 |
| Map-Reduce | 0.438 | 62,321 | 1.2× | 0 |
| DAG | 0.438 | **439,319** | 24.5× | 0 |
| Plan-Execute | 0.250 | 123,175 | 2.0× | **78** |

The simplest paradigm wins on quality and is simultaneously cheapest; the most elaborate
returns less than half the quality for 9.5× the cost.

**This is governed by a validity threat we state rather than bury**: on this corpus every
task fits in one prompt, and in that regime reading everything is optimal and the ordering is
close to tautological. §4 exists to escape it, and §9 records that the escape is built but
not yet measured.

## 7.2 Tool quality governs the variance that topology is credited with

| group | cost range |
|---|---|
| do not use tools (Direct, CoT, Map-Reduce) | **1.2×** |
| use tools (ReAct, Reflection, Plan-Execute, DAG) | **50×** |

Tool quality does not shift the mean; it governs the variance — and asymmetrically. The
readers are expensive and stable; the searchers are cheap-or-ruinous, and which face the coin
shows is decided by retrieval. A paradigm costing between 2,877 and 251,374 tokens depending
on whether search worked is not something one can budget for.

**Implication**: a benchmark that does not report the quality of its tool surface is not
measuring topologies. It is measuring its retriever wrapped seven ways.

## 7.3 An A/B on three accounting signals, and what a replicate did to it

Same corpus, same retriever, same four cells; the only difference is the tool surface,
recorded as a variable per row.

The three paradigms that use no tools were **identical to the token** across arms. That
control is what makes the rest attributable; without it any difference could be run noise.

A third arm added four working-memory tools (`note`, `notes`, `plan`, `advance`) and
produced a result we did not plan for. **The model never called them**: across 28 rows,
one note, one compaction and zero plans. On a corpus where everything fits in one prompt
there is no context pressure, so a working-memory tool has no work to do — exposing a
capability is not the same as providing one. That arm is therefore a null result on the
tools, and something more useful: an accidental **replicate** of the accounting surface.

As a replicate it says what the aggregate hides. **Reproducibility is per-task, not
global.** On three of the four cells, 10 of 10 quality values are identical across the
pair. On the fourth — the three-hop chain — 2 of 4 flipped, and both flipped by the full
unit. The instability is not spread thinly across the study; it is concentrated in the
hardest task, where the outcome is bimodal. Cost was reproducible nowhere: mean spread
2.05×, maximum 5.43× at *identical* quality.

That converts the A/B from a list of effects into a list of effects with an attribution
test. An effect that moves only the coin-flip cell is not attributable; one that moves a
reproducible cell is.

| paradigm | Δ reported | cells moved | attributable | verdict |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| DAG | +0.500 | c3 (unstable), c5 (stable) | **+0.250** | half survives |
| Reflection | +0.250 | c3 (unstable) only | **0.000** | **withdrawn** |
| ReAct | +0.000 | none | 0.000 | null, confirmed |
| Plan-Execute | −0.139 | c2, c5 (both stable) | **−0.139** | survives |

**We withdraw the Reflection result.** It came entirely from the cell that flips on its
own, and at n=1 it is indistinguishable from noise.

**The DAG's cost result survives, and it is the strongest thing here.** Total cost fell
**3.05×** against a replicate spread of 1.62× on the same measure, and it fell exactly
where the mechanism predicts: the two runaway cells, 251k → 51k and 143k → 10k, both
carrying stall warnings. The other two cells did not fall at all. So telling an iterative
loop that its retriever has stopped producing is worth a 3× cost reduction with the
mechanism visible in the trace — while the quality gain that accompanied it is half what
we first reported.

**Plan-Execute's degradation survives, and on reproducible cells**: +0.444 on one and a
full −1.000 on another. Our own analysis had called coverage accounting "the
highest-leverage addition" for this paradigm. It made it worse. Knowing the answer is
incomplete is useless when the architecture cannot complete it: the sub-agents have
finished by the time synthesis learns units are missing. **A diagnostic without the
capacity to act is worse than none** — and this is the one A/B effect that both moved
stable cells and contradicted our prediction.

**A second-order effect we did not predict.** `read_all` reduced the cost of a full read by
7.6× and raised ReAct's net cost by 27%: it cheapened the *act*, and therefore the
*decision*, of reading everything.

**One cell did not run.** Two rows recorded zero tokens and an empty answer — not a wrong
answer but an absent one. They are excluded from every figure above rather than scored as
zero, since a paradigm that never executed must not be pooled with one that answered
badly. Both belong to the cells marked *sin-correr* in the artefacts.

# 8. Failure mechanisms

These rest on traces rather than magnitudes, and they are what we would defend.

## 8.1 Decomposition destroys sequential dependency

Both decomposing topologies fail both coupled cells, and both **with the evidence read**.
The DAG spent 251,374 tokens on the three-hop chain, read 4 of 4 chain units, and scored
zero. A chain is sequential by definition — hop 2 cannot be formulated before hop 1 is
answered — so splitting it into parallel sub-questions leaves the blackboard holding the
right units without the structure that orders them. This is a property of decomposing, not
a coincidence of two implementations.

## 8.2 Iterative loops amplify retrieval failure rather than absorbing it

On the two-hop cell the DAG issued 31 keyword searches, read **zero** relevant units, and
spent 142,694 tokens. After the third search the retriever had already demonstrated it would
not find the target; the verify-replan loop read that as *search again*.

This inverts a design intuition. Verification loops are added *for* robustness; here the loop
is the amplification mechanism. Without it the failure would have cost 10k tokens rather than
143k.

## 8.3 One failure no tool can fix

Map-Reduce fails both coupled cells and reads zero relevant units in all four, because by
construction it views each unit in isolation. A chain and a cross-unit comparison are
unresolvable that way however many times they are examined.

\1

**And the price of that failure scales with the corpus while the failure does not.** The
same paradigm, on the same cell, at two unit sizes:

| corpus | units | calls | relevant units read | cost | quality |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| gold_v2 | 48 | 49 | **0** | 13,931 | 0.000 |
| gold_deep | 48 | 49 | **0** | **276,355** | 0.000 |

Identical cardinality, identical call count, identical zero — and **19.8× the cost**. Thirty
times more text per unit bought exactly thirty times more of nothing, because the obstacle
was never the amount of evidence. This is the sharpest argument we have for deciding before
running rather than after: a paradigm whose limitation is structural does not fail more
loudly at scale, only more expensively, and an approach that learns from outcomes pays that
bill every episode until it has learned what arithmetic could have told it for free.

## 8.4 Attribution requires the trace

The tool-usage trace separates *never saw the evidence* from *saw it and reasoned wrongly*.
Without it a zero is a mystery; with it, it is a diagnosis. "The searching topology lost" is
uninterpretable when the searcher never reached a relevant unit — that is a statement about
the tool surface, and only a failure with the evidence in hand is evidence about the control
structure.

# 9. Limitations and threats to validity

**Everything fits in one prompt.** The corpus behind §7 is 16k tokens at its widest, so
read-everything is both correct and cheapest and the ordering is near-tautological. Corpora
at 135k, 483k and 1.27M tokens are generated and verified, and the harness now records
infeasibility as distinct from error — but they have not been run. **This is the single
largest threat and the next measurement.**

**n=1 per cell, and the variance is now partly measured.** An unplanned replicate (§7.3)
shows reproducibility is per-task: 10 of 10 quality values identical on three cells, 2 of 4
flipped by a full unit on the fourth and hardest. Cost was reproducible nowhere — mean
spread 2.05×, maximum 5.43× at identical quality. **Any quality effect at or below one
flip's worth of a four-task mean (±0.250) is indistinguishable from noise at n=1**, which
is why one reported effect is withdrawn above and another is halved. No proper noise floor
has been measured: the harness computes the oracle-gap bias directly by treating `k`
replicates of the *same* paradigm as `k` distinct ones, and the protocol requires
`repeat ≥ 3` with all decisions taken against the net gap. Not yet run.

**One model, and it cannot be pinned.** `gpt-5-chat` rejects an explicit temperature, so
sampling is at the model default. A reasoning deployment that accepts temperature 0 is
available as an escape but changes what is measured.

**Synthetic corpus.** Ground truth is exact and independently re-derived, and structural
parameters are dials rather than hopes — but the distribution of real tasks over those dials
is unknown. Public benchmarks are required for external validity and are not yet used.

**Latency is not comparable.** The DAG runs sequentially here where it would run concurrent
waves; and once workers contend, per-row wall-clock stops measuring latency. Quality and
token counts remain exact.

**Two novelty claims are unverified**: consolidation of the control policy (§6.3) and
provenance-gated proposition discovery. Six other claims were conceded to prior work after
reading abstracts rather than full papers, which is itself a risk: a mistaken concession costs
as much as a mistaken claim.

**Reproducibility caveat.** A seed alone does not pin a corpus. When the generation algorithm
changed, the same seed produced a different world; manifests now stamp a generator version and
results across versions must not be pooled.

# 10. Conclusion

The prize in paradigm selection is real and measured, and the literature is pursuing it with
selectors that must always choose. We argue that three things belong in front of that
problem. Feasibility is arithmetic and prunes the space for free, separating a cardinality
bound from a context bound that are routinely conflated. Selection pays only under a
condition we can state and check, and the condition implies abstaining most of the time.
And the variance that topology choice is credited with is largely governed by the tool
surface: fifty-fold among tool-using paradigms against 1.2× among those that read.

Our strongest measured result is not about topologies at all. Telling an iterative
topology that its retriever had stopped producing cut its cost 3.05× against a replicate
spread of 1.62×, with the fall localised in exactly the two runaway cells the mechanism
predicts. An unplanned replicate also forced us to withdraw one reported effect and halve
another, which is the discipline working rather than failing. The three largest cost failures we found were not fixed by
better topologies or better models but by accounting signals that did not exist.

What we do not have is a validated selector, a noise floor, or any measurement in the regime
where reading everything is impossible. The harness for all three is built and the protocol
is registered in advance, including the decision rule for the outcome in which no selector
beats the fallback — which would be a result, and is stated as publishable before the data
is in.
